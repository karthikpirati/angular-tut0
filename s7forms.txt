There are two types of forms in Angular

1) Template Driven Forms :
  a) import {FormsModule} from '@angular/forms'
  b) To bind the data we use ngModel
 
2) Reactive Forms - 
  a) import {ReactiveFormsModule} from '@angular/forms'
  b) To bind the data we use FormGroup with formControlName or just FormControl
  3) FormGroup is a object that groups all FormControl objects
