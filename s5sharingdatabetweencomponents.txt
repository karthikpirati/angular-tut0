There are two ways to share data between components

1) If there is Parent-Child relationship between components then we can use @Input and @Output

@Input - to pass the data from parent to child using property binding [].
@Output - to send the response back to parent using Event binding () and EventEmitter.emit()

2)If there is no Parent-Child relationship between components then use

Subject/Behaviour Subject with Observable.

Subject acts like a publisher and subscriber so from 
one component we can push data subject.next(data we want to send)
and we can subscribw to this from as many components as we can.
