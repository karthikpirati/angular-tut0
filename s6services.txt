Mainly purpose of Service is reuablity
If we have any resuable code create the Service
And we can reuse this in any component inside appliaction.



Dependency Injection : 
Instead of we creating objects the Angular creates the object for service 
For that we have to keep @Injectable on top of Service
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class AuthenticationService {
}

If we create service usinsg cli command it will take care of keeping this annotation

ng g s "service-name" 

By using constructor we can inject service inside component


constructor(private authenticationService: AuthenticationService) {}
